# Pyramid Data Structure

Create a data structure to represent a pyramid of numbers.  

The structure should be able to seed itself given either a flat array of numbers, or a an array of arrays:

[11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 111]

and 

[
    [11],
    [22, 33],
    [44, 55, 66],
    [77, 88, 99, 111]
]

Should generate the same Pyramid.

The Pyramid should be optimized for surveying and finding paths down through the Pyramid, starting from a given node.
